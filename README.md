# Daniel Dewes – Developer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal **developer portfolio landing page**.
The goal of this project is to present my skills, professional background, and showcase personal and professional projects in a clean, modern, and responsive web interface.

---

## 🚀 Technologies

The landing page was built using a modern web stack focused on performance, scalability, and developer experience:

* **Frontend Framework:** React (with Next.js or CRA, depending on setup)
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS for utility-first and responsive design
* **UI Components:** Shadcn/UI and Lucide icons for polished visuals
* **Animations:** Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactive experience
* **Build & Bundling:** Vite or Next.js build pipeline for optimized delivery
* **Assets:** Custom `.ico` favicon and responsive image handling

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The architecture of the landing page follows a **component-based structure**, making it modular and easy to extend:

* **`/components`** → Reusable UI components (navbar, hero, skills grid, project cards, contact form)
* **`/pages` or `/app`** → Page routing (Home, Projects, Contact)
* **`/public`** → Static assets such as icons, images, and favicon (`dev_icon.ico`)
* **`/styles`** → Tailwind and global styles configuration

### Page Structure

1. **Hero Section** – Introduction with a headline, short bio, and call-to-action.
2. **About Me** – Summary of background, skills, and work style.
3. **Skills** – Icons/grid highlighting technologies: GeneXus, Python, JavaScript, C, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, Firebird, APIs, Postman, Jira.
4. **Projects** – Portfolio with GitHub/demo links (including *100 Days of Python* projects).
5. **Contact** – Contact form + links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.
